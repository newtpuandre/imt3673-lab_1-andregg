# imt3673-lab_1-andregg

## Notes:
* The app is created using the Android API 28 ( Android Pie ), this is a bad assumption from my side... (I can show the app in person on my phone if needed)
* The balance is stored and passed arround as an int within the app.
* Inorder to get the correct balance: Whole euros = int / 100 and cents = int % 100;. A couple checks need to be done in order to be confident that the cents are displayed correctly. cents < 10. See code (Transfer activity : calculateRequest();)

# Marking 

Marking/testing/scoring of the implementation is based on the form specified below. The total score is based on the sum of the individual items tested. The test either "Fails" or "Passes" - the task cannot be "Partial", ie. partial means "Fail". Each test case has a score associated with it - most are worth 1 point, but some are worth more. The marking schedule is based on ticking the appropriate test cases and then summing up those that have been ticked. 

* [x] (1pt) The app has a custom icon (not the default Android one).
* [x] (1pt) The app `MainActivity` loads.
* [x] (1pt) The app's `MainActivity` contains all required UI elements as per SPEC.
* [x] (1pt) Pressing Android's "back button" on the `MainActivity` always quits the app, AND, this behaviour is not hardcoded in the code, ie. the code does not handle the Android back button presses, but instead, relies on the default Android behaviour.
* [x] (1pt) Pressing `btn_transactions` moves the user to TransactionsActivity.
* [x] (1pt) The default founding transaction from Angel is done correctly and visible in the `TransactionsActivity`. The user balance in `lbl_balance` matches the funding transaction.
* [x] (1pt) TransactionsActivity shows new payments correctly.
* [x] (1pt) TransactionsActivity moves the user back to MainActivity on "back botton" press.
* [x] (1pt) Pressing btn_transfer moves the user to TransferActivity.
* [X] (5pts) The `TransferActivity` has all required UI, the balance amount handling is working correctly with the appropriate lbl_amount_check error messages, and the btn_pay is enabled/disabled when appropriate. Pressing the `btn_pay` creates the new transaction, visible in TransactionsActivity, and updates the user balance accordingly.
* [X] (1pt) The app never crashes. In particular, changing from landscape to portrait and vice-versa does not crash the app.

**Bonus tasks**

* [ ] (2pts) The app UI elements are all well laid-out, look appealing and tidy, and the app has a solid/professional feel, ie. buttons properly centred, UI elements well-arranged, colour schemes appealing, and so on. The app works well in both, portrait and landscape modes. 
* [ ] (1pt) The app codebase is well-structured, readable, and follows professional Java and Android practices.
* [x] (1pt) The Recipient list for the drop-down is done programmatically such that the list source of names is provided as a string array from MainActivity, eg. `list = String[]{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dawn", "Elvis", "Frode"};` This requires to dynamically update the TransferActivity UI based on the data passed to it from `MainActivity`. 
* [ ] (1pt) An extra bonus point for something outside of scope.
